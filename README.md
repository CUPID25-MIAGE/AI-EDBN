# Extended Dynamic Bayesian Network: Detecting Anomalies in Multidimensional Hybrid Business Process Logs</h1>

This repository contains all implementation files and experiments conducted for the Extended Dynamic Bayesian Networks introduced in
[1] and further extended in [3] where we try to detect anomalies in Business Process logs. Also work done in [2] can be found
in this repository.

All experiments in the papers can be reproduced using the files in the Experiments directory in the project.

## Project Structure
- [Bohmer](https://github.com/StephenPauwels/edbn/tree/master/Bohmer): Contains our own implementation of the Likelihood Graphs introduced by Bohmer et al in [4]
- [Nolle](https://github.com/StephenPauwels/edbn/tree/master/Nolle): Contains the original implementations used by Nolle et al in [5]
- [EDBN](https://github.com/StephenPauwels/edbn/tree/master/eDBN): Contains our implementation of our Extended Dynamic Bayesian Network model
- [Experiments](https://github.com/StephenPauwels/edbn/tree/master/Experiments): Contains all files used for the experiments found in [1] and [3]
- [Concept Drift](https://github.com/StephenPauwels/edbn/tree/master/Concept%20Drift): Contains the files used for the BPI Challenge 2018 [2]
- [Utils](https://github.com/StephenPauwels/edbn/tree/master/Utils): Some extra implementations regarding datastructures, preprocessing and data generation
- [Data](https://github.com/StephenPauwels/edbn/tree/master/Data): Data used for the experiments
